# Robbie-Rotten<br>
A simplistic, user-powered Discord pirating bot.
## Disclaimers
- This bot and it's owner(s) are not responsible for any viruses that may be uploaded or downloaded.
- I, LumiteDubbz, do not condone pirating or Torrenting of any kind, this bot is a programming project only.
## Basic setup
***This will be DMed to the guild owner upon being invited***:
**1**. Run the `$setuploader [role]` command, where `[role]` is the name of the role you want to be able to upload files for others to use.
**2**. Then, users with that role can run the ```$upload [name] [url]``` command, where ```[name]``` is the name of the software and ```[link]``` is the download link.
**3**. Finally, any user may run the ```$download [name]``` command, where ```[name]``` is the name of the software; the bot will then provide the link
