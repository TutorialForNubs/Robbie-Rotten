# Robbie-Rotten<br>
A simplistic, user-powered Discord pirating bot.<br>
<br>
## Disclaimers<br>
1. This bot and it's owner(s) are not responsible for any viruses that may be uploaded or downloaded.<br>
2. I, LumiteDubbz, do not condone pirating or Torrenting of any kind, this bot is a programming project only.<br>
<br>
## Basic setup<br>
This will be DMed to the guild owner upon being invited:<br>
1. Run the `$setuploader [role]` command, where `[role]` is the name of the role you want to be able to upload files for others to use.<br>
2. Then, users with that role can run the `$upload [name] [url]` command, where `[name]` is the name of the software and `[link]` is the download link.<br>
3. Finally, any user may run the `$download [name]` command, where `[name]` is the name of the software; the bot will then provide the link.<br>
<br>
## Credits<br>
