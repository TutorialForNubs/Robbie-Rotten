# Robbie-Rotten
A simplistic, user-powered Discord pirating bot.

<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
1. This bot and it's owner(s) are not responsible for any viruses that may be uploaded or downloaded.
2. I, LumiteDubbz, do not condone pirating or Torrenting of any kind, this bot is a programming project only.

<h2>Basic setup</h2>
This will be DMed to the guild owner upon being invited:
1. Run the `$setuploader <role>` command, where `<role>` is the name of the role you want to be able to upload files for others to use.
2. Then, users with that role can run the `$upload <name> <url>` command, where `<name>` is the name of the software and `<link>` is the download link.
3. Finally, any user may run the `$download <name>` command, where `<name>` is the name of the software; the bot will then provide the link.

<h2>Credits</h2>
`Mr Turner You On ;)`#6484 for the idea and asking me to make it.
Lumite#1234 for the making of the bot.
